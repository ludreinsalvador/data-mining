    "\n",
    "#### Code Breakdown:\n",
    "- `df[df[\"balance\"] > 0]` filters the dataset to include only students who have an outstanding balance.\n",
    "- `sns.boxplot(x=\"payment_status\", y=\"balance\", data=...)` creates a boxplot of balances grouped by payment status.\n",
    "- `plt.title()`, `xlabel()`, `ylabel()` – Add informative labels for better understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation:\n",
    "- The box represents the **interquartile range (IQR)**—the middle 50% of student balances.\n",
    "- The **line inside the box** shows the **median balance**, which appears to be around ₱25,000.\n",
    "- The **whiskers** extend to the minimum and maximum unpaid amounts (₱10,000 to ₱40,000).\n",

    "- Identifying the central tendency and spread of student balances\n",
    "- Understanding tuition affordability patterns\n",
    "- Planning billing interventions or scholarship policies\n"

It serves as an excellent hands-on foundation for beginner data analysts and student researchers.\n",
